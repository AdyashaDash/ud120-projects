# Naive Bayes
* Example of supervised vs. non-supervised learning applications
* Features and labels examples (notes, tempo, pitch -> features; like, dislike -> label)
* Bumpiness scatter plots -> choosing visually what fits
* Decision surfaces + what makes a surface good?
* Getting started with sklearn - Gaussian NB
* Accuracy, training and testing datasets
* Bayes Rule, cancer test example, prior and posterior
* Quizzes on normalization, total probabilities
* "Naive" Bayes, because e.g. it doesn't take into account word order
* Strength: easy, can handle big feature spaces
* Weakness: fails on phrases (when it comes to text prediction)
* Mini project: finding the author. Track accuracy
